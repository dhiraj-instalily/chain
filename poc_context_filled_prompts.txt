Use the following thought tempelate to anlyze the RECORD and provide distilled information:
1. Core Information Categories:
   a. Equipment Details: Manufacturer, model, type, and identifying information
   b. Reported Issues: Customer complaints or observed problems
   c. Technician Actions: Steps taken, diagnostics performed, and outcomes
   d. Parts Information: Required parts, availability, and ordering details
   e. Customer Information: Contact details, site information
   f. Follow-up Actions: Next steps, pending tasks, or escalations

2. Key Patterns and Indicators:
   a. Equipment Details: Recognize manufacturer names and model numbers.
   b. Reported Issues: Look for issue-specific terms (e.g., ‚Äúdoors not closing,‚Äù ‚Äúcustom made‚Äù).
   c. Technician Actions: Pay attention to sequences describing interactions with customers
   d. Parts Information: Words like "parts," "replace," "order," product numbers
   e. Follow-up Actions: Phrases like "need more info," "leaving so in continue"

3. Information Extraction Framework:
   Step 1: Scan for equipment details in structured fields and comments
   Step 2: Identify reported issues in comment fields
   Step 3: Extract technician actions and observations
   Step 4: Note any parts information or requirements
   Step 5: Create sections for each category (Equipment Details, Reported Issues, Technician Actions, Follow-Up Requirements).
   Step 6: Ensure that each category is clearly labeled and contains all relevant details.

4. Challenges and Considerations:
   - Inconsistent terminology or abbreviations across records, Solution: Use context clues and cross-reference with other records if possible.
   - Missing or incomplete information in some fields, Solution: Create a glossary of common terms and synonyms.
   - Multiple issues or actions described in a single comment, Solution: Break down the analysis into smaller batches.
   - Distinguishing between customer-reported and technician-observed issues
   - Identifying critical information buried in lengthy comments
   - Handling records with multiple updates or technician visits

The goal is to create records that allows for efficient querying and analysis of resolved repair cases, enabling technicians to quickly find relevant information when dealing with similar issues in the future from DISTILLED_THOUGHT. If it has multiple issues and resolutions, extract more than one JSONs.
The fields are - manufacturer_name, manufacturer_number, model_number, issue_customer, issue_technician, resolved_item_no, resolved_item_description, equipment_type_description
Your output should be strictly in JSON: 
{
        "manufacturer_name": "LBC Bakery",
        "manufacturer_number": "LBE",
        "model_number": "LMO-MAX-G-LP",
        "issue_customer": "Pass thru cooler not cooling properly",
        "issue_technician": "Compressor running but not cooling; possible refrigerant leak",
        "resolved_item_no": "N/A",
        "resolved_item_description": "Installed new oven, Dormont hose, gas fittings, water line, and fittings. Assembled oven racks and set insulation."
        "equipment_type_description": "Convection Oven (Gas)"
}
DISTILLED_THOUGHT:
Based on the provided thought template, here's the analysis of the RECORD:

1. Core Information Categories:

- Ran to shop for 3rd valve (only had 2 on truck)

d. Parts Information:
Item No: SBR1178202
Item Description: VALVE,HI-OFF,NAT/LP

e. Customer Information:
Not provided in the record

f. Follow-up Actions:
Unit is back in service

2. Key Patterns and Indicators:
The analysis identified manufacturer names, model numbers, specific issue terms (e.g., "burners valve are loose"), technician actions (e.g., "replaced 3 physically broken burner valves"), and parts information (e.g., "VALVE,HI-OFF,NAT/LP").

3. Information Extraction Framework:
The analysis followed the steps to extract and categorize information from the record.

4. Challenges and Considerations:
- The record contained multiple updates in different comment fields, which were consolidated.
