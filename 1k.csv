It also appears that the float switch is not working correctly. Please service as soon as possible.  Please note that if this is deemed a non-warranty issue, then customer would  be responsible for all charges. Please take photos of machine conditions and  related to repairs. Please contact Champion Service @ 1-800-858-4477 from  site. This will be for regular business hours.","10/21/2022: Arrived at location to diagnose Champion Dishwasher. Upon arrival, manager stated that they keep getting a “Call for service” error on display. Manager states champion Tech Support walked them through a “service reset” procedure. Still having problems. Immediately upon arrival, I started a wash cycle to see if error message would duplicate, it did not. However, wash cycle was set to 2 minutes, after 10 minutes in wash cycle, machine never changed over to rinse. Wash temp read 175 on display, I took a reading with temp meter, read 170. Determined that was not the issue. Watched I/O screen during fill process, heating process  and wash process to determine if the float switch was operating properly. Float switch works as designed.Checked all the temps and noticed booster tank temp was low. Machine will not change from wash to rinse unless rinse water is at 180 degrees in the booster tank. Temp was 150. I then opened up the panels and began taking readings at the booster tank and the wash tank element. I was getting proper voltage between each of the three legs on the booster, but was getting low amp draw, should be getting about 9 amps, was reading 1.2. Voltage at element in wash tank was correct as well. Checked the 2 solid state relays for power that supply booster tank, both relays working as designed. Called tech support, they determined that it’s a bad element in the booster tank itself. Champion will be sending part directly to the office along with the part number. Drained washer, cut off power at the box, reinstalled panels, cleaned up after myself. All pics in file room. MAS  10/27/2022: Arrived at location to change out heating element in booster tank. Elements were broken and twisted, took a while to get old element out. Booster tank was full of lime, front to back and all walls of tank. Scraped out and cleaned all lime from booster tank. Installed new element, reestablished all electrical connections and slid relay rack back in place. Turned on unit to fill tank to check for any leaks. Tanks held water, no leaks.

SHE ESCORTED ME TO THE ALTO SHAAM COOK AND HOLD TO THE RIGHT OF THE GRIDDLE/RANGE. I INFORMED HER THE TICKET SAID IT WAS FOR A HENNY PENNY HEATING TABLE. SHE SAID THE LADY WHO CALLED IT IN DID NOT KNOW THE BRAND OF THE EQUIPMENT AND THAT THEIR HEATING TABLE WAS WORKING FINE. I CHECKED OVER THE HEATING TABLE TO CONFIRM IT WAS WORKING PROPERLY. ALL 3 ELEMENTS WERE HEATING AND CYCLING AND THE AIR TEMP WAS AROUND THE 153 DEGREE SET POINT. CHECKED BOTH BLOWERS AND THEY WERE RUNNING. THE TOP HEATING ELEMENTS ARE ALL WORKING PROPERLY AND THE WATER PAN IS HEATING LIKE IT SHOULD. OPENED THE SLIDING GLASS DOOR AND LET THE HEAT OUT THEN SHUT THE DOORS AND MONITORED THE TEMP AS IT CLIMBED BACK UP TO 153 DEGREES AND CYCLED. DO NOT SEE ANY ISSUE WITH THE TABLE AT THIS TIME SO I CHECKED OVER THE ALTO SHAAM COOK AND HOLD AS REQUESTED. CUSTOMER SAID IT TOOK FOREVER TO HEAT UP AND WOULD NOT REACH TEMP. UPON FIRST GLANCE I FOUND THE DOOR GASKET HAD A LARGE CHUNCK MISSING FROM IT AND THE REST WAS IN BAD SHAPE (PICTURE IN THE FILE ROOM). THE COOLING FANS WERE BOTH LOCKED UP AND HAD BEEN CUT OUT FROM THE CIRCUIT. THE FRONT PANEL WAS MISSING THE TIMER KNOB AND THE TEMP DIALS ARE NOT TOTALLY LEGIBLE. CHECKED THE CABINET TEMP AND IT WAS AROUND 175 DEGREES. REMOVED THE TOP PANEL AND FOUND IT WAS IN BAD SHAPE (PICTURE IN THE FILE ROOM). OHMED OUT THE HEATERS AND ONE HEATER WAS PULLING AROUND 2.6 AMPS AND THE OTHER 2 WERE NOT PULLING ANY AMPS. CHECKED THE VOLTAGE AT THE TERMINAL BLOCKS FOR THE HEATERS AND ONLY HAD 120 VOLTS. CHECKED THE POWER SWITCH AND FOUND ONLY ONE OF THE POLES WAS SENDING VOLTAGE. REPLACED THE SWITCH WITH ONE FROM MY VAN AND TURNED THE UNIT BACK ON. THE ONE HEATER WAS STILL PULLING AROUND 2.6 AMPS BUT ONE OF THE OTHER HEATERS WAS PULLING AROUND 5.3 AMPS AND THE 3RD HEATER WASN’T PULLING ANY AMPS. REMOVED THE HEATERS FROM THE TERMINAL BLOCKS AND OHMED THEM OUT. THE 5.2 AMP HEATER WAS READING AROUND 45 OHMS BUT THE OTHER 2 WERE READING 0 OHMS. CHECKED THE HEATERS TO GROUND AND FOUND THE HEATER PULLING 2.6 AMPS WAS GROUNDED. THAT IS WHY IT WAS NOT PULLING THE CORRECT AMPERAGE AND MAY HAVE BEEN THE REASON THE POWER SWITCH BURNED UP. I REMOVED THE HEATER FROM THE TERMINAL BLOCK THEN REINSTALLED THE LID. TURNED THE UNIT ON AND MONITORED THE TEMP. THE TEMP HAS GOT TO 240 DEGREES AND CONTINUES TO CLIMB. THE UNIT WOULD NEED NEW HEATERS, COOLING FANS, PILOT LIGHTS AND A DOOR GASKET. DUE TO THE AGE AND CONDITION OF THE UNIT I WOULD NOT PUT ANY MORE MONEY INTO THE UNIT.

So, yesterday the technician did replace the circulation pump, 2A fuses and data cable, and upon return the drain screen was again removed and more debris was removed from the pump. Now 4A fuses need to be replaced along with the drain pump and another circulation pump may be needed again because of this issue, both ovens will need to be off and completely cool again to schedule the repair.

Powered up unit and monitored temp. Unit got down to 10 degrees and temp began to rise to 50 degrees. Then it would go back to 10 degrees and rise again then we checked over all operation and took amp draws on defrost heaters to make sure they were not coming on and then we had to put valve ports on lines to check pressures while running and found system a little low on 404 so then had to charge up and then let it run then let it reach set temp in box and took temp reading working good","On arrival found unit running with cabinet probe reading 97 degrees. Evaporator fans were running and actual box temp was 50 degrees. Removed cover off evaporator and found that evaporator was frozen up, was able to remove coil probe and found that it was also not reading correct temp. Determined that door gaskets, coil probe, and cabinet probe will need to be replaced.   7/26/19  Changed out all door gaskets on freezer and then pulled unit apart and changed out the bad probes that were reading extremely high temps when it was not. Then put back together and now we got the freezer were will run got temp down to 8 degrees in box and then all the sudden temp started to rise up to 30 degrees and so we checked to see if the defrost heaters are coming on when it goes into that low temp and found relay for it was sending voltage and then got Becky from traulsen on the phone and explained to her what was going on and she said that the relay was sticking and needs to be changed.

He has ran his store for several months with only 1 oven functioning. Can we have a full assessment of the issue. Requesting an experienced tech to identify the issue with this oven. Thanks  When I arrived on location got with manager Hillary  and she tells me this morning they noticed fan error so I go into the main controls and found error code 3.0.1.1 and started looks like this morning and this is a completely different issue than was with the other oven calls and the past calls were lines that had broken and sprayed detergent into pumps and burned them up on top oven and because drains were stopped up on both is what caused steam to destroy electrical and all is from maintenance not being performed and not taking care of ovens   and they were made aware of that and even have talked to manager Jason and deli manager  also about that they need to get a maintenance scheduled at least twice a year multiple times.  When I arrived I got with manger Hillary  and  deli supervisor they tell me that bottom oven is going out on error with blower so I turn on and then went into history error and found had error 3.0.1.1 and then called convotherm and spoke with Scott in tech support so then went through I/O control and manually went through and turned on main fan and and did not come on then pulled side panel and verified it is not coming on then found VFD had indicator light on it but no display so then Scott tells me need to change it and before I did that I went through tracing electrical back to main then to disconnect and found fuses blown on a phase so then had to drive across town to get fuses and return and replaced and powered up and then went back into IO control and started checking each component while I was on hold again with convotherm and then found that the rinse aid pump is now not pumping and must have blew the fuses and only had one leg of 3 phase so explained to convotherm tech   4/22/22  When I arrived on site got with deli manager Retha and explain to them what I was there to do and then unloaded oven turn power off then went to bottom of it and pulled front cover and unhook drain then got the cover out-of-the-way and had to pull pump bracket and pulled pumps and sensor out unwire the bad pump and install new one then put everything back on the bracket slid back into position and locked it in then had to re-hook the drain and install the front panel after doing that powered everything on then went into the I/O controller and manually turned on rinse and detergent pump one at a time and make sure sensor is sensing pressure and it is now and was not before so it’s working good and showed staff on site also. Again got with managers and explained need to have maintenance on Regular bases or will keep having issues.    NEED TO SWITCH TO CONVOTHERM WARRANTY BUT SHOP WAS CLOSED AFTER 6 WHEN FINISHED",When I arrived I got with manger Hillary  and  deli supervisor they tell me that bottom oven is going out on error with blower so I turn on and then went into history error and found had error 3.0.1.1 and then called convotherm and spoke with Scott in tech support so then went through I/O control and manually went through and turned on main fan and and did not come on then pulled side panel and verified it is not coming on then found VFD had indicator light on it but no display so then Scott tells me need to change it and before I did that I went through tracing electrical back to main then to disconnect and found fuses blown on a phase so then had to drive across town to get fuses and return and replaced and powered up and then went back into IO control and started checking each component while I was on hold again with convotherm and then found that the rinse aid pump is now not pumping and must have blew the fuses and only had one leg of 3 phase so explained to convotherm tech  4/22/22  When I arrived on site got with deli manager Retha and explain to them what I was there to do and then unloaded oven turn power off then went to bottom of it and pulled front cover and unhook drain then got the cover out-of-the-way and had to pull pump bracket and pulled pumps and sensor out unwire the bad pump and install new one then put everything back on the bracket slid back into position and locked it in then had to re-hook the drain and install the front panel after doing that powered everything on then went into the I/O controller and manually turned on rinse and detergent pump one at a time and make sure sensor is sensing pressure and it is now and was not before so it’s working good and

This was very difficult as wires were tight with no extra slack. Once I plugged it in the fans came on but not the compressor. Read zero volts on compressor c-s or c-r. Unplugged molex and plugged in unit, inserted meter leads and measured 240vac. Plugged back up and get nothing. Suspect bad harness. Cut out the harness and installed maleAnd female disconnects to form a new harness, still won’t run. Contact Chris with Serveware and told him what was going on. Next I plugged up the start components straight to 240vac from terminal block and the compressor came on. Chris requested that I retrofit the unit to run off of a contactor in place of the solid state relay. Identified power to tie in 120vac to one side of contactor coil and took the input to solid state relay and attached to other side of contactor coil. Unit now working but noticed the compressor was really hot. Added water to the condensate pan to help lower the head pressure and observed an occasional bubble in the pan. Contacted Chris about this because I thought unit was getting too much superheat and suspected a leak and compressor shell reading 165 degrees. Used flammable gas leak detector and it detects a leak puddling up in the condensate pan either from hot gas loop or migration from the evaporator. Chris told me to disable the unit so it couldn’t be plugged in because it’s now hazardous. Chris further advised me to let the customer know that they intended on replacing the unit and go ahead and close out the call. Pictures, video, and manufacture instructions in fileroom.

CHECKING FOR LEAKS I FOUND THAT THE DEFECTIVE VALVE HAD SPRUNG ANOTHER LEAK ON THE 3/8 “ TUBE GOING INTO COMPRESSOR. A SIMILAR LEAK WAS FIXED ON THE PREVIOUS VISIT. I ELIMINATED THIS NEW LEAK TODAY WHEN THE OLD DTC VALVE WAS REPLACED. I PUMPED THE REFRIGERANT INTO THE CONDENSER, THEN ISOLATED THE COMPRESSOR SO I COULD REMOVE OLD DTC VALVE. NEW ONE WAS THEN INSTALLED AND LEAK CHECKS WERE COMPLETED. PRESSURE TESTING DIDN’T REVEAL ANY LEAKS SO THE REFRIGERANT SYSTEM WAS EVACUATED WITH A VACUUM PUMP. AFTER EVACUATION THE VACUUM HELD, AND ALL THE SERVICE VALVES WERE REOPENED SO I COULD PUT THE SYSTEM BACK INTO SERVICE. PRESSURES LOOKED GOOD, BUT DUE TO THE SECOND FREON LEAK 1 LB.
